Mobile Services Authentication with Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD) via Auth0
======================

You need: a Mobile Service (with the standard Todo table generated, Insert and Read permissions set 
to Only Authenticated Users). Also, you need an Auth0 account, that is configured for an enterprise 
connection to Windows Azure AD plus under Add-ons for Mobile Services.
